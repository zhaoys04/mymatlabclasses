\section{Introduction}
The PIMeasurement program is used to measure the LI and IV curve of laser diodes
using current source, temperature controller and power meter. All the
instruments are wrapped in according matlab classes. 
\section{Usage}
The program can be called through the command ``PIMeasurement'' in Matlab. Make
sure the classes of all the instruments that you are going to use are in the
same directory as ``PIMeasurement.m'' or can be accessed by Matlab through
pathdef. If everything goes well, the first window you can get is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}
\begin{figure}[htbp]

	\label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}

You will find two text edits, one popup menu and four buttons in this window.
Most of these components are self-explained. The first two text edits ask for
the gpib addresses of the current source and temperature controller since the
two instruments are controlled through GPIB interfaces. The following popup menu
asks for the connection type of the power meter. There are two options to
communicate our power meter. One is through USB and the other one is through
serial ports. If you want to use ``usb'' port, make sure ``usbdll.dll'' and
``NewpDll.h'' at the same directory as ``PIMeasurement.m''. If you want to use
serial port, make sure you select the right ``com'' port(``com1'',``com2'',etc.) in
the popup menu. The ``Load Default'' button is used to load the default parameters
to overwrite the current parameters. The default setup is restored every time
when the program is called. The ``Save as Default'' button is used to save the
current parameters as the default setup. The ``OK'' button is used to accept the
current parameters and continue to next window. The ``Cancel'' button is used to
exit the program.

After the ``OK'' button is pressed to accept the parameters, the
Fig.~\ref{fig:main_window} will be shown.

There are four panels in this window. Each panel represents an equipment and is
plotted and controlled by the according class. The equipment name is shown in
the title region of each panel. In Fig.~\ref{fig:main_window}, you can find
``ILX3744B Continuous Current Source'', ``ITC503 Temperature Controller'', ``NewPort
1931 Power Meter'' and ``Result'' in the title region. 

In the ``ILX3744B Continuous Current Source'' panel, the first text edit called
``Current Set'' is to set the output current. You should press ``enter'' button in
keyboard after the value is entered in this text edit to send the value to the
current source. The following two texts(``Current Output(mA)'', ``Voltage(V)'') show
the current and voltage information. These values will be updated periodically
when the communication is established. The red text ``Source NOT Connected'' shows
the connection status and it will change to green text ``Source Connected'' after
the connection is established. The button below is used to connect to the
current source. After clicked, if the connection is established, the text on the
button will change to ``Disconnect'' and used to disconnect the current source.
The red text ``Output is OFF'' shows the status of output enable. If the current
output is enabled by clicking the ``Output'' button below, the red text will
change to green text ``Output is ON''. There are two popup menus in this panel,
one is for the operation mode of current source and the other one is to set the
current range of current source. You can choose the proper one for your
measurement.

In the ``ITC503 Temperature Controller'' panel, the ``Connect'' button and red text
have the same function as mentioned above. The text bar below is used to show
the current temperature of the sensor which will be refreshed periodically when
connected. The text ``Out of Range'' shows the state of temperature stability.
Once the temperature is within 0.1K away from the set temperature, it will show
``Stable''. The text edit below is used to set temperature. You should press
``enter'' to confirm the set temperature. The ``Mode'' popup menu is used to show
the operation mode of the temperature controller. This parameter is to set how
you can operate the controller (remote or local) and whether to lock the front
panel of the controller (locked or unlocked). To have our gui remote controller
work, this has to be set as ``Remote\&Locked''. The popup menu below is used to
set the operation mode of heater and gas control. Since we don't have a gas
controller, the only thing that matters to us is the heater mode(Manual or
Auto). If the heater mode is set to be manual, the heater voltage below will be
used to set the heater power level. 

In the ``NewPort 1931 Power Meter'' panel, the ``Wavelength(nm)'' text edit shows
and sets the wavelength of the power meter. Once the power meter is connected by
clicking the ``Connect'' button, this text edit will be updated by the current
wavelength set in the power meter. You can enter your wavelength in this text
edit and press ``enter'' to confirm. The ``Average Time(s)'' text edit below is to
set how many seconds you want to average the measurement results. Once you
require the average power of the power meter, this is the time that the meter
used to average the results. The ``Power'' text below shows the instant power
level read from power meter periodically. The ``Read'' button is used to update
the power read instantly after pressing this button. 

In the ``Result'' panel, you should tell the program the start current, the end
current and the step. The ``Prefix'' and ``Suffix Next'' text edits are used to set
the filename if you want to save the measurement data. The filename will be
constructed in the format: \$Prefix\_\$Suffix.mat. And the number in ``Suffix
Next'' will be added by 1 automatically after you press ``Save'' button. The
checkbox ``save to database'' next to the ``Suffix Next'' has not been implemented
yet, so will be ignored here for now. The axes below is for viewing and checking
the measurement results. The result will be refreshed after new data point is
available. The ``Start'' button is used to start new measurement. The ``Stop''
button is used to stop the current measurement. The ``Save'' button is used to
save the current result to a mat file named after ``Prefix'' and ``Suffix Next''(See
above for details). Make sure the current output is enabled in the current
source before starting a new measurement.
